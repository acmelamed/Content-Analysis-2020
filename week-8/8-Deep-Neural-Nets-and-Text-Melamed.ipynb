    "## Week - 8 - Deep Neural Nets and Text\n",
    "\n",
    "In this week we introduce the use of Deep Neural Networks to work with text. We have already seen some uses of neural networks for text in our classification HW, where we used a simple neural network--the one-layer perceptron--to classify text. It performed quite well, but comes up short in more sophisticated classification tasks, such as in predicting intent. We have also seen slightly deeper, 2-level neural nets in the form of word embeddings such as Word2Vec. While they work well, they have some drawbacks, such as representing words with multiple meanings in a singular space. \n",
    "\n",
    "BERT, which is a language model built using bidirectional encoders, allows us to take advantage of a powerful pre-trained model which we can then use to perform our own tasks based on data we analyze. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we use ```huggingface/transformers```, a python package that allows for easy interface to use pre-trained BERT models. It is built using Tensorflow and PyTorch, two computational graph packages which are built specifically for creating powerful neural networks. We will also be introducing Keras, which allows us to easily build Neural Networks in an abstracted way. Keras is a popular way to understand how we can stack layers to create such Neural Networks, but to reach state-of-the-art results we will stick with using BERT and similar models that can be tuned to extremely high performance on specific language understanding and generation tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate this, we begin by using the [Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability](https://nyu-mll.github.io/CoLA/). We will also use BERT by learning how to extract embeddings from such a model and use it to semantically probe sentences. There are a number of new packages and methods we will be using so be sure to update lucem_illud_2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "## NOTE\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook **requires** GPUs for training models in section 1 and section 3. To train models, please use this [Google Colab file](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_G6iGqiXb-zPBTurRxd7cgGrXyNaKGsA) to create the models. Note that I have only given you view access: please create your own colab file to train your models, using the code and instructions I have given in the Colab file. So while you have to do the homework on this notebook, the models which you will train should be done on Google Colab, which has GPU access. If you happen to have GPU access on your personal machines or some other way to train the models, you are welcome to do that too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if you run the computationally intensive models on your local computer they will take a long time!"
